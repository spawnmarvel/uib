 Color origins Three glasses of wine colors (from left to right), white, red and aged white wine with brown color. The color of the wine mainly depends on the color of the drupe of the grape variety. Since pigments are localized in the exocarp (skin) of the grape drupe, not in the juice, the color of the wine depends on the method of vinification and the time the must is in contact with those skins, process called maceration. Teinturier grape is an exeption in that it has also a pigmented pulp. The blending of two or more varieties of grapes can explain for the color of certain wines, like the use of Australian Rubired. Red drupe grapes can produce white wine if they are quickly pressed and the juice not allowed to be in contact with the skins. The color is mainly due to plant pigments notably phenolic compounds (anthocyanidins, tannins ...). The color depends on the presence of acids in the wine. It is altered with the wine aging by reaction between the different active molecules present in the wine, these reactions generally giving rise to a browning of the wine, leading from red to a more tawny color. The use of a wooden barrel (generally oak barrels) in aging also affects the color of the wine. Part of the color of a wine can be due to co-pigmentation of anthocyanidins with non pigmented other flavonoids or natural phenols (cofactors or ‚Äúcopigments‚Ä?). Ros√© wine is made by the practice of saign√©e or by blending a white wine with a red wine.  Color evolution The presence of a complex mixture of anthocyanins and procyanidins can increase the stability of color in wine. As it ages, the wine undergoes chemical autoxidation reactions involving acetaldehyde of its pigments molecules. The newly formed molecules are more stable to the effect of pH or sulfite bleaching. The new compounds include pyranoanthocyanins like vitisins, pinotins and portosins and other polymeric derived pigments.  Colors Glasses of Beaumes de Venise white and ros√©. Glass of Amontillado sherry. A glass of Vin Santo with its characteristic amber color. Beringer "white" Zinfandel Main colors of wine are†: red white (light colored wine) Ros√© (pinkish in color) yellow (or straw color), see for instance vin jaune, a special and characteristic type of white wine made in the Jura wine region in eastern France, Juran√ßon or Sauternes Orange wine, a white wine that has spent some time in contact with its skin, giving it a slightly darker hue Other†: Burgundy (color), a shade of purplish red Sangria (color), a color that resembles Sangr√≠a wine Ox blood, probably referring to ancient practice of fining red wines with dry powdered blood  Scientific color determination The International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) provides methods to assess the color of a wine using a spectrophotometer and the calculation of indices in the Lab color space.
