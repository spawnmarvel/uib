 Variations The energy needed to increase the temperature of a gram of water by 1 Â°C depends on the starting temperature and is difficult to measure precisely. Accordingly, there have been several definitions of the calorie. The two perhaps most popular definitions used in older literature are the 15 Â°C calorie and the thermochemical calorie. The factors used to convert measurements in calories to their equivalents in joules are numerically equivalent to expressions of the specific heat capacity of water in joules per gram or kilojoules per kilogram. Name Symbol Equivalent in Joules Notes Thermochemical calorie calth â‰¡ 4.184 J  4 Â°C calorie cal4 â‰ˆ 4.204 J the amount of energy required to warm one gram of air-free water from 3.5 Â°C to 4.5 Â°C at standard atmospheric pressure. 15 Â°C calorie cal15 â‰ˆ 4.1855 J the amount of energy required to warm one gram of air-free water from 14.5 Â°C to 15.5 Â°C at standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa). Experimental values of this calorie ranged from 4.1852 J to 4.1858 J. The CIPM in 1950 published a mean experimental value of 4.1855 J, noting an uncertainty of 0.0005 J. 20 Â°C calorie cal20 â‰ˆ 4.182 J the amount of energy required to warm one gram of air-free water from 19.5 Â°C to 20.5 Â°C at standard atmospheric pressure. Mean calorie calmean â‰ˆ 4.190 J 1â?„100 of the amount of energy required to warm one gram of air-free water from 0 Â°C to 100 Â°C at standard atmospheric pressure. International Steam Table calorie (1929) â‰ˆ 4.1868 J 1â?„860 international watt hours = 180â?„43 international joules exactly. International Steam Table calorie (1956) calIT â‰¡ 4.1868 J 1.163 mWÂ·h = 4.1868 J exactly. This definition was adopted by the Fifth International Conference on Properties of Steam (London, July 1956). IUNS calorie â‰¡ 4.182 J This is a ratio adopted by the Committee on Nomenclature of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences.  Conversions The conversion factor between calories and joules is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of liquid water (in SI units). One gram calorie is approximately: 4.184 J (joules) 0.003964 BTU (British thermal units) 1.163Ã—10âˆ’6  kWh (kilowatt hours) 2.611Ã—1019  eV (electron volts) One kilogram calorie (food calorie) is approximately: 4.184 kJ 3.964 BTU 0.001163 kWh 2.611Ã—1022  eV  Notes and references
