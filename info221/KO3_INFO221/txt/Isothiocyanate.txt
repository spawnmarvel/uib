 Synthesis General method for synthesis of isothiocyanates by reacting primary amine (e.g. aniline) with carbon disulphide in aqueous ammonia resulting in precipitation of ammonium dithiocarbamate derivative , which then treated with lead nitrate to yield corresponding isothiocyanate derivative. Another method rely on a tosyl chloride mediated decomposition of a dithiocarbamate salts that are generated in first step.  Reactions In general, isothiocyanates act as electrophiles with the carbon atom as the electrophilic center.  Biological activity Isothiocyanates, such as phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) and sulforaphane, have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis and as such are useful chemopreventive agents against the development and proliferation of cancers. They work on a variety of levels, the most notable one being the inhibition of carcinogenesis through inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which oxidize compounds such as benzopyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into more polar epoxy-diols, which can then cause mutation and induce cancer development. Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) has been shown to induce apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, and, in some cases, is even able to induce apoptosis in cells that are resistant to some currently used chemotherapeutic drugs, for example, in drug-resistant leukemia cells that produce the powerful apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, isothiocyanates have been the basis of a drug in development that replaces the sulfur bonds with selenium, with far stronger potency against melanoma.
