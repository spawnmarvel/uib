 Use of chromium in the body Trivalent chromium is the state that has been discussed as a possible essential trace metal; hexavalent chromium is toxic and mutagenic. Trivalent chromium was thought to be a constituent in the so-called glucose tolerance factor (GTF). GTF has been hypothesised to be a metalloprotein complex that is formed when the oligopeptide chromodulin, which consists of the four amino acid residues aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, and glycine, is bonded with four (Cr3+) centers. Some studies have suggested that chromodulin could bind to the insulin receptor and stimulate insulin signaling. However, the existence of this glucose tolerance factor remains uncertain, a 2001 academic review concluded that "To date, no chromium-containing glucose tolerance factor has been characterized, the purpose of the low-molecular-weight chromium-binding protein is questionable, and no direct interaction between chromium and insulin has been found."  Dietary guidelines The US dietary guidelines for adequate daily chromium intake were lowered in 2001 from 50â€“200 Âµg for an adult to 30â€“35 Âµg (adult male) and to 20â€“25 Âµg (adult female). These amounts were set to be the same as the average amounts consumed by healthy individuals. Consequently, it is thought that few Americans are chromium deficient. Approximately 2% of ingested chromium(III) is absorbed, with the remainder being excreted in the feces. Amino acids, vitamin C and niacin may enhance the uptake of chromium from the intestinal tract. After absorption, this metal accumulates in the liver, bone, and spleen. Trivalent chromium is found in a wide range of foods, including: whole-grain products, processed meats, high-bran breakfast cereals, coffee, nuts, green beans, broccoli, spices, and some brands of wine and beer. Most fruits and vegetables and dairy products only contain low amounts. Most of the chromium in people's diet comes from processing or storing food in pans and cans made of stainless steel, which can contain up to 18% chromium. The amount of chromium in the body can be decreased as a result of a diet high in simple sugars, which increases the excretion of the metal through urine. Because of the high excretion rates and the very low absorption rates of most forms of chromium, acute toxicity is uncommon.  Symptoms The symptoms of chromium deficiency caused by long-term total parenteral nutrition are severely impaired glucose tolerance, a loss of weight, and confusion. Another patient also developed nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy).  Supplementation Chromium picolinate Chromium picolinate is the most commonly used synthetic supplement. However, recent studies "have concluded that such supplements have no demonstrated effects on healthy individuals." A meta-analysis in 2002 found no effect on blood glucose or insulin in healthy people, and the data were inconclusive for diabetics. Subsequent trials gave mixed results, with one finding no effect in people with impaired glucose tolerance, but another seeing a small improvement in glucose resistance. In a 2007 review of these and other clinical trials it was again concluded that chromium supplements had no beneficial effect on healthy people, but that there might be an improvement in glucose metabolism in diabetics, although the authors stated that the evidence for this effect remains weak. A 2003 pilot trial of 15 patients suggested that chromium picolinate might have antidepressant effects in atypical depression. A larger trial in 2005 set up to test this finding found no effect on depression in its test group, but suggested that the use of chromium supplementation could help to reduce carbohydrate cravings and regulate appetite in these patients. A post-hoc analysis of a subpopulation of patients in this study that experienced high carbohydrate cravings suggested that these patients experienced significant improvements in their depression compared to those treated with a placebo. This supplement is purported to correct imbalances in glucose metabolism due to chromium deficiency, even though the occurrence of such a deficiency is extremely rare in countries where the supplement is sold. The mechanism by which this complex enters the cells in the body differs from that for the introduction of trivalent chromium found naturally in food does, and for this reason the safety of this supplement is debatable, since chromium is toxic at high levels. For chromium to be used in the cells it must be released from chromium picolinate, in a process in which the chromium becomes reduced. This process can possibly lead to the formation of dangerous reactive oxygen species. Although it is controversial if supplements should be taken by healthy adults eating a normal diet, chromium is needed as a component of the defined liquid diet that is given to patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN), since deficiency can occur after many months of this highly restricted diet. As a result chromium is added to normal TPN solutions, although the trace amounts from even in supposedly "chromium free" preparations may be enough to prevent deficiency in some individuals. Indeed, a 1992 paper in The Lancet suggested that adding chromium to feeding solutions given to children produces excessive levels of this metal in their bodies.  References
