Dietetic Technician, Registered (DTR) DTRs work with RDs and undergo similar training though the education requirement is a minimum of an Associate's degree.  Professional educational programs ADA's Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education (CADE) is recognized by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation and the United States Department of Education as the accrediting agency for education programs that prepare dietetics professionals. CADE accredits and approves more than 600 undergraduate and graduate didactic, dietetic technician and supervised practice programs.  ADA Foundation The American Dietetic Association Foundation (ADAF) was established in 1966 as a 501(C)(3) public charity. Its mission is to fund the future of the dietetics profession through research and education. The Foundation's vision is to be a leader in promoting and achieving healthy weight for children, helping to reduce the growing prevalence of childhood obesity. ADAF achieves its goals by providing support for research, education and public awareness programs. For the 2006-2007 academic year, ADAF has invested in the future of the dietetics profession by awarding approximately $270,000 for more than 200 graduate, undergraduate and continuing education scholarships.  ADA concerns ADA publishes position papers on public health regarding pediatric (children's) health, food technology, food safety, geriatrics (elderly) health, health-care reform, obesity and the full range of food and nutrition topics. The association also sponsors National Nutrition Month in March in the U.S. To help better communications with the US government, ADA has offices in Washington, DC.  Controversy Concerning the ADA The ADA receives some percentage (approximately 10% according to its most recent annual report) of its funding from food companies, including Abbott Nutrition, CoroWise, General Mills, Kellogg's, Mars, McNeil Nutritionals, Pepsico, SOYJOY, Truvia and Unilever. In addition, the ADA lists Aramark, The CocaCola Company, The National Dairy Council and the Hershey Center for Health and Nutrition as partners. The ADA has claimed that these partnerships with food industry groups do not affect its diet recommendations: "Itâ€™s important for ADA to be at the same table with food companies because of the positive influence that we can have on them. For ADA, relationships with outside organizations are not about promoting companiesâ€™ products; they are about creating nutrition messages that people can understand and act upon to improve their health and that of their families." However, many people have criticized these partnerships. Marion Nestle Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, has written: "Respected ADA colleagues: as long as your organization partners with makers of food and beverage products, its opinions about diet and health will never be believed independent (translation: based on science not politics) and neither will your's. Consider the ADA's Nutrition Fact Sheets, for example, each with its very own corporate sponsor (scroll down to the lower right hand corner of the second page to see who paid for the Facts). Is the goal of ADA really the same as the goal of the sponsors - to sell the sponsor's food products? Is this a good way to get important scientific messages to the public? ADA members: how about doing something about this!" Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber of The Center for Media and Democracy (an independent, non-profit, non-partisan media and consumer watchdog group) claim the ADA "has learned not to bite the hand that feeds it"  Joan Gussow, a former head of the nutrition education program at Teachers College at Columbia University writes that "They  never criticize the food industry"  More pointedly, celebrity nutritionist and author Jonny Bowden writes, â€œThe American Dietetic Association at this point has no useful purpose on the planet except to protect its union members and shill for its flatliner positions, which are now running about two decades behind their sell-by date.â€?  Additional publications The Journal of the American Dietetic Association (JADA) is a monthly peer-reviewed publication involved in the dietetics field, with original research, critical reviews, and reports on dietetics and human nutrition.
