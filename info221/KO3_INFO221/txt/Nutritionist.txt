 Regulation of the title "nutritionist"  Canada The title "nutritionist" is protected by provincial law in Quebec, Alberta, Nova Scotia and British Columbia. The term â€œRegistered Dietitian/Nutritionistâ€? is protected by law in New Brunswick. For example, the Nova Scotia Dietetic Association is the regulatory body for professional dietitians and nutritionists in that province, authorized by legislation, the Professional Dietitians Act, "to engage in registration, quality assurance, and when necessary, the discipline of dietitians in Nova Scotia to ensure safe, ethical and competent dietetic practice." Professional requirements include a Bachelor's Degree in Dietetics/Nutrition from an accredited university, a program of practical training, and successful completion of a registration examination (the "Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination" or CDRE).  United Kingdom Nutritionist is not a protected term in the UK, unlike dietitians, who must be registered with the Health Professions Council. Different organizations use their own criteria to define a nutritionist. According to one of these, the Nutrition Society, â€œthe function of a Nutritionist is to elicit, integrate, disseminate and apply scientific knowledge drawn from the relevant sciences, to promote an understanding of the effects of nutrition, and to enhance the impact of food on health and well-being of animals and/or peopleâ€?. They accredit nutritionists, conferring the titles Associate Nutritionist (ANutr) and Associate Public Health Nutritionist (APHNutr). For these they consider an undergraduate training  sufficient for associate membership. Full registration as a Registered Nutritionist (R Nutr.), or Registered Public Health Nutritionist (RPHNutr) requires at least three years work experience and the fulfilment of key competencies required to operate safely and effectively. They must also agree to abide by a code of ethics and maintain their standards for working with the public. Although there are many undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in nutrition in the UK, anyone can refer to him- or herself as a nutritionist without any qualifications. A person can legally describe themselves as a nutritionist and obtain qualifications such as a degree by mail from a non-accredited institution; to demonstrate this, British writer Dr Ben Goldacre applied online to the American Association of Nutritional Consultants in the name of his dead cat and was sent "certified professional" membership (which he could state as a qualification in the UK) for US$60. He has, by way of analogy, compared the distinction between dietitians and nutritionists as similar to that between dentists and "toothyologists". Nonetheless, it is recognized that nutritionists have an increasingly important role to play in health care in the UK. In part due to shortages of registered dietitians, since 2002 the growth in the number of jobs for nutritionists has reportedly grown faster in the National Health Service than in any other sector.
