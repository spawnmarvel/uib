 Signs and symptoms Typical ulcerating dermatosis seen on a Malawian patient with kwashiorkor. One of many kwashiorkor cases in relief camps during the Nigerianâ€“Biafran War. The defining sign of kwashiorkor in a malnourished child is pedal edema (swelling of the feet). Other signs include a distended abdomen, an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates, thinning hair, loss of teeth, skin depigmentation and dermatitis. Children with kwashiorkor often develop irritability and anorexia. Victims of kwashiorkor fail to produce antibodies following vaccination against diseases, including diphtheria and typhoid. Generally, the disease can be treated by adding food energy and protein to the diet; however, it can have a long-term impact on a child's physical and mental development, and in severe cases may lead to death. In dry climates, marasmus is the more frequent disease associated with malnutrition. Another malnutrition syndrome includes cachexia, although it is often caused by underlying illnesses. These are important considerations in the treatment of the patients. Kwashiorkor can lead to death. People can recover from the illness by having a gradual build up of nutrients, but they will not grow properly and will probably be quite small.  Possible causes Disability-adjusted life year for protein-energy malnutrition per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002.   no data   less than 10   10-100   100-200   200-300   300-400   400-500   500-600   600-700   700-800   800-1000   1000-1350   more than 1350 There are various explanations for the development of kwashiorkor and the topic remains controversial. It is now accepted that protein deficiency, in combination with energy and micronutrient deficiency, is necessary but not sufficient to cause kwashiorkor. The condition is likely due to deficiency of one of several types of nutrients (e.g., iron, folic acid, iodine, selenium, vitamin C), particularly those involved with anti-oxidant protection. Important anti-oxidants in the body that are reduced in children with kwashiorkor include glutathione, albumin, vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, if a child with reduced type one nutrients or anti-oxidants is exposed to stress (e.g. an infection or toxin) he/she is more liable to develop kwashiorkor. Ignorance of nutrition can be a cause. Dr. Latham, director of the Program in International Nutrition at Cornell University cited a case where parents who fed their child cassava failed to recognize malnutrition because of the edema caused by the syndrome and insisted the child was well-nourished despite the lack of dietary protein. One important factor in the development of kwashiorkor is aflatoxin poisoning. Aflatoxins are produced by molds and ingested with moldy foods. They are toxified by the cytochrome P450 system in the liver, the resulting epoxides damage liver DNA. Since many serum proteins, in particular albumin, are produced in the liver, the symptoms of kwashiorkor are easily explained. It is noteworthy that kwashiorkor occurs mostly in warm, humid climates that encourage mold growth. Protein should be supplied only for anabolic purposes. The catabolic needs should be satisfied with carbohydrate and fat. Protein catabolism involves the urea cycle, which is located in the liver and can easily overwhelm the capacity of an already damaged organ. The resulting liver failure can be fatal. In a study of twins from Malawi, presented March 9 at the International Human Microbiome congress in Vancouver, kwashiorkor affected one twin in 50% of a study group, but both twins only 7% of the time. When gut bacteria from the twins were transplanted into germ-free mice, the mice receiving bacteria from affected twins lost more weight on a typical Malawian diet consisting largely of corn flour and water with some vegetables. It was speculated that transplantation of fecal bacteria may help affected children.  See also Anemia Cachexia Emaciation Marasmus Starvation  References
