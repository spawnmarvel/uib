 Protein Sources This bodybuilding supplement contains whey protein and creatine monohydrate, as well as vitamins and other supplements. Bodybuilders often take a powdered form of protein, which contains the essential building blocks for muscle. The powder is mixed with water, milk or juice and often flavoring, resulting in a form known as a "shake" (as in milkshake) or "pudding". Protein powder is generally consumed immediately before and after exercising, or in place of a meal. The theory behind this supplementation is that having a sufficient protein intake allows for efficient growth and repair of muscle tissue. Currently, no consensus has been reached in determining whether or not an individual in exercise training can benefit from protein and amino acid supplements. Protein supplements come in various forms: ready to drink shakes, bars, bites, oats, gels and powders. Protein powders are available in a wide variety of flavors including strawberry, vanilla and chocolate. Some advertisements claim that they aid in fat loss, slowing the aging process and muscle building. Whey protein contains high levels of all the essential amino acids and branched-chain amino acids. It also has the highest content of the amino acid cysteine, which aids in the biosynthesis of glutathione. For Bodybuilders whey protein provides amino acid used to aid in muscle recovery. Whey protein is derived from the process of making cheese from milk. There are two types of whey protein: whey concentrate and whey isolate. Whey concentrate is 29%â€“89% protein by weight where whey isolate is 90%+ protein by weight. Casein protein (or milk protein) has glutamine, and casomorphin. Soy protein Soybeans contain isoflavones, a type of phytoestrogen. Egg-white protein is a lactose- and dairy-free protein. Hemp seed contains complete and highly-digestible protein and hemp oil is high in essential fatty acids. Rice protein- when made from the whole grain it is a complete protein source that is highly digestible and allergen free. Shaker Bottle commonly used to mix supplements. Has mesh inside to avoid lumps in the mixture. Although it is shown that athletes and bodybuilders may need an increased intake of protein, the exact amount is highly individualized and dependent on the type and duration of the exercise as well as the physiological make up of the individual. Some health experts have criticized protein shakes as being unnecessary for most people that consume them, since most users already get enough protein in the normal varied diet with enough calories. Some studies suggest low-calorie dieters, vegetarians, haphazard eaters and those who train very heavily may benefit from protein supplements. The body can only metabolize 5-9 grams of protein per hour; excessive daily intake can cause weight gain, kidney problems, osteoporosis, or diarrhea. Osteoporosis occurs since excreting extra protein can put pressure on the kidneys and lead to bone loss, since calcium is taken from bones in the excretion process. Weight gain occurs as the body cannot store protein, excess protein will either be burned as energy or stored as fat (if you are already getting the calories you need). Research by Tarnopolsky et al. (1988) showed that for bodybuilding individuals, 1.97g of protein per kg of body weight per day is recommended, whereas endurance athletes require 1.37g/kg/d of protein. Their findings indicated that protein requirements are actually much lower than might be expected and that protein supplements therefore may not be as effective as is popularly believed. Studies suggest that there are different protein requirements for anaerobic and aerobic exercise. Endurance athletes in aerobic activity may have increased daily protein intake at 1.2-1.4 g per kg body weight per day where strength training athletes performing anaerobic activity may have increased daily protein intake needs at 1.4-1.8 g per kg body weight so as to enhance muscle protein synthesis or to make up for the loss of amino acid oxidation during exercise. Consumer Reports testing found that due to contamination, some bodybuilding protein shakes purchased in the New York metro area exceeded USP standards for exposure to heavy metals when three or more servings a day were consumed. All 15 protein shakes tested were positive for traces of heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury.  Branched-chain amino acids Amino acids are the building blocks of protein; the body breaks consumed protein into amino acids in the stomach and intestines. There are three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Each has numerous benefits on various biological processes in the body. Unlike other amino acids, BCAAs are metabolised in the muscle and have an anabolic/anti-catabolic effect on it. BCAAs account for 33% of muscle protein.   Glutamine Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid found in human muscle and is commonly found in supplements or as a micronized, instantly soluble powder because supplement manufacturers claim the body's natural glutamine stores are depleted during anaerobic exercise. Serum glutamine is used by the body to counteract the acidosis that results from exercise; in order to replenish the loss of glutamine from the bloodstream, the body catabolises glutamine from the muscle. Ingestion of supplemental glutamine may therefore help ensure a ready supply for the muscles. It is also argued that a deficiency may lead to a weakened immune system and wasting of muscle tissue.. Some studies have shown there to be no significant effect of glutamine on bench press strength, knee-extension torque or lean muscle mass when compared to controls taking a placebo, though another study found that glutamine is beneficial in raising T-helper/suppressor cell ratio in long distance runners.  Essential fatty acids The essential fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid) may be especially important to supplement while bodybuilding; these cannot readily be made in the body, but are required for various functions within the body to take place. Bodybuilders often go on such low fat diets that they become fat-deficient. Fatty fish, which are rich in essential fatty acids, include salmon, trout, and mackerel; fish oils can also be taken in supplement form. Polyunsaturated vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower, and safflower oils, cannot provide linoleic acid. Soybean oil is the only commonly-consumed oil that contains linoleic acid. Flaxseed oil, often sold as a supplement on its own, is an ideal source of alpha-Linolenic acid, which can also be found in walnuts and pumpkin seeds.  Meal replacement products Meal replacement products (MRPs) are either pre-packaged powdered drink mixes or edible bars designed to replace prepared meals. MRPs are generally high in protein, low in fat, have a low to moderate amount of carbohydrates, and contain a wide array of vitamins and minerals. The majority of MRPs use whey protein, casein (often listed as calcium caseinate or micellar casein), soy protein, and/or egg albumin as protein sources. Carbohydrates are typically derived from maltodextrin, oat fiber, brown rice, and/or wheat flour. Some MRPs also contain flax oil powder as a source of essential fatty acids. MRPs can also contain other ingredients that are believed to be beneficial for bodybuilders. These can include, but are not limited to: creatine monohydrate, glutamine peptides, L-glutamine, calcium alpha-ketoglutarate, additional amino acids, lactoferrin, conjugated linoleic acid, and medium chain triglycerides. A sub-class of MRPs are called 'weight gainers' these have a high ratio of carbohydrates:protein. Where a MRP would have a 0.25-2:1 ratio of Carbohydrates:Protein a weight gainer would have in the order of between 3-5:1 ratios. They also tend to be named XY 2000 whereby the number refers to the calories per serving.  Prohormones Main article: Prohormone Prohormones are precursors to hormones and were most typically sold to bodybuilders as a precursor to the natural hormone testosterone. This conversion requires naturally occurring enzymes in the body. Side effects are not uncommon, as prohormones can also convert further into DHT and estrogen. To deal with this, many supplements also have aromatase inhibitors and DHT blockers such as chrysin and 4-androstene-3,6,17-trione. To date most prohormone products have not been thoroughly studied, and the health effects of prolonged use are unknown. Although initially available over the counter, their purchase was made illegal without a prescription in the US in 2004, and they hold similar status in many other countries. Additionally, their use is proscribed by most sporting bodies.  Creatine Main article: Creatine supplements Creatine is an organic acid naturally occurring in the body that supplies energy to muscle cells for short bursts of energy (as required in lifting weights) via creatine phosphate replenishment of ATP. A number of scientific studies have shown that creatine can improve strength, energy, muscle mass, and recovery times. In addition, recent studies have also shown that creatine improves brain function and reduces mental fatigue. Unlike steroids or other performance-enhancing drugs, creatine can be found naturally in many common foods such as herring, tuna, salmon, and beef, making it difficult to ban it from sporting competitions. Creatine increases what is known as cell volumization by drawing water into muscle cells, making them larger. This intracellular retention should not be confused with the common myth that creatine causes bloating (or intercellular water retention). Creatine is sold in a variety of forms, including creatine monohydrate and creatine ethyl ester, amongst others. Though all types of creatine are sold for the same purposes, there are subtle differences between them, such as price and necessary dosage. Non-supplemental sources of creatine include various types of offal, red meat, and kidney meat. In The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding, 2nd ed., author Arnold Schwarzenegger states: Creatine monohydrate is regarded as a necessity by most bodybuilders. Creatine monohydrate is the most cost-effective dietary supplement in terms of muscle size and strength gains. â€¦ There is no preferred creatine supplement, but it is believed that creatine works best when it is consumed with simple carbohydrates. This can be accomplished by mixing powdered creatine with grape juice.  Thermogenic products Main article: Thermogenics A thermogenic is a broad term for any supplement that the manufacturer claims will cause thermogenesis, resulting in increased body temperature, increased metabolic rate, and consequently an increased rate in the burning of body fat. Until recently almost every product found in this supplement category comprised the "ECA stack": ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin. However, on February 6, 2004 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of ephedra and its alkaloid, ephedrine, for use in weight loss formulas. Several manufacturers replaced the ephedra component of the "ECA" stack with bitter orange or citrus aurantium (containing synephrine) instead of the ephedrine. To date research on the effectiveness of this new combination has not been conclusive.  Testosterone boosters There are several naturally occurring plants and vitamins as well as synthetic chemicals that supplement companies claim may produce an increase in testosterone levels. However, the validity of many of these products is questionable due to a lack of valid scientific research showing their effectiveness, and especially due to evidence that they are ineffective. Some commonly taken supplements of this type are ZMA and Tribulus terrestris. In a placebo-controlled study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, a statistically significant increase in strength and arm circumference was achieved with an extract of Eurycoma longifolia . In another study on male rats, Eurycoma longifolia extract at the highest administered dosage resulted in an increase in size of a muscle (the levator ani) of about 20 percent over controls. A 2008 study concluded that Eurycoma longifolia is capable of suppressing estrogens which are potent inhibitors of testosterone production. The relatively new drug 4-androstene-3,6,17-trione may increase the testosterone-estrogen ratio. Excess testosterone can cause undesirable side effects, such as hair loss and acne, and may be converted into estrogens, which can have undesirable effects on males, such as gynecomastia and testicular atrophy.
