 Overnutrition Main article: Overnutrition  Metabolic Obesity is caused by consuming too many calories compared to the amount of exercise the body is performing, causing a distorted energy balance. It can lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Obesity is a condition in which the natural energy reserve, stored in the fatty tissue of humans and other mammals, is increased to a point where it is associated with certain health conditions or increased mortality. The low-cost food that is generally affordable to the poor in affluent nations is low in nutritional value and high in fats, sugars and additives. In rich countries, therefore, obesity is oftentimes a sign of poverty and malnutrition while in poorer countries obesity is more associated with wealth and good nutrition. Other non-nutritional causes for unhealthy obesity included: sleep deprivation, stress, lack of exercise, and heredity. Acute overeating can also be a symptom of an eating disorder. Goitrogenic foods can cause goitres by interfering with iodine uptake.  Vitamins and micronutrients Vitamin poisoning is the condition of overly high storage levels of vitamins, which can lead to toxic symptoms. The medical names of the different conditions are derived from the vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called "hypervitaminosis A". Iron overload disorders are diseases caused by the overaccumulation of iron in the body. Organs commonly affected are the liver, heart and endocrine glands.  Deficiencies Main article: Malnutrition Disability-adjusted life year for nutritional deficiencies per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002. Nutritional deficiencies included: protein-energy malnutrition, iodine deficiency, vitamin A deficiency, and iron deficiency anaemia.   no data   less than 150   150-300   300-450   450-600   600-750   750-900   900-1050   1050-1200   1200-1350   1350-1500   1500-1750   more than 1750  Proteins/fats/carbohydrates Protein-energy malnutrition Kwashiorkor Marasmus Mental retardation  Dietary vitamins and minerals Calcium Osteoporosis Rickets Tetany Iodine deficiency Goiter Selenium deficiency Keshan disease Iron deficiency Iron deficiency anemia Zinc Growth retardation Thiamine (Vitamin B1) Beriberi Niacin (Vitamin B3) Pellagra Vitamin C Scurvy Vitamin D Osteoporosis Rickets  Complex disorders In some cases, eating too much of one thing can induce an apparent deficiency of something else. A common example occurs when livestock eat locoweed: locoweed contains a toxin that inhibits enzymes, simulating a deficiency of the enzymes.  Foot notes
